Explanation:
+ I used VS 2022, .Net 6.0
+ Start ConsoleCrawler project (Program.cs)
+ Provide a URL, and an optional "crawl depth" (write 0 for no limitation of depth)
+ A folder in the app folder called "Out" will be created, and the downloaded files will be saved there


To improve:
+ Unit tests
+ File, folder, project structure
+ Logging, exception handling, documentation
+ Parallelization of link downloads

Was overall fun though :)
